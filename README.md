# Dominant-Color-for-Image-Segmentation
This repository contains a web application on finding the dormant color for image segmentation. The python code uses kmeans clustering algorithm for finiding the dormant color in the image, and generate a new image with those dormant colours only. However, number of dormant colors is a user specified parameter.
